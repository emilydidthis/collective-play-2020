## There Are Other People With Your Name
 
**INT. EX-BOYFRIEND'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT**  
"Hello, this is Bill Meyers speaking... is this also... Bill Meyers?" My boyfriend at the time desperately wanted the domain billmeyers.com, however it was reserved for no end in sight by an actor who gigs as Santa. This phone call went on for another 10 minutes, no domain was exchanged, and only confusion insued. As a witness, I had to keep stiffling giggles. My boyfriend gave menacing glares in return. Without any context, it sounded as though my boyfriend was having an intense argument with himself, like a true psycho. In the end however, Bill could not persuade the older Bill to give up his 'doname'. 

**INT. TISCH SCHOOL OF THE ARTS - DOC WORKSHOP SCREENING - DAY**  
My classmate Ian Ginsberg made an entire documentary about trying to find other Ian Ginsbergs in the world. Luckily, there was one in NYC that happened to be the CEO of C.O. Bigelow's, a pharmacy-apothecary. You'll have to watch the film yourself, but Ian's deadpan-hilarity matched against an unknowing and serious CEO makes for quite the interview.

**INT. MY LIFE - EVERYDAY**  
While I myself haven't had one of these one on one interactions with another Emily, I encounter it passively all the time. I, too, want the domain emilyzhao.com and have trouble branding myself against the Others. The Emily at emilyzhaodesign.com is really talented and there's another Emily in NYC that is the Product Lead at Lyft. Both seem really cool. My friend Leah Fessler actually found her counterpart on Instagram and they support each other as fellow artists. Maybe I should reach out and start some relationships with myself.
